### About
The Maine Journal is a digital publication for showcasing the excellent work of undergraduate students at the University of Maine. Student work is published using a variety of digital media, to best represent the quality of the work. The Maine Journal highlights individual stories of academic excellence, identified through faculty recommendations, announcements of campus awards or fellowships, performing arts events, etc. The Maine Journal staff members connect with these students, collect and digitize their work, and conduct and record interviews that are published with the work, to provide context. The Maine Journal also manages an online portfolio system for students to organize, archive, and share original work with the university community and the public.

### Vision
University of Maine students are producing excellent work â€” in the classroom, in research labs, in performance spaces and in personal projects. The Maine Journal strengthens the University of Maine community and enhances the undergraduate experience by providing online mechanisms for undergraduates to organize, archive, and share their original work across all disciplines and beyond the University.

### Staff
The undergraduate student staff of the Maine Journal has been growing and evolving since its conceptualization in 2011. Today a staff of six continues to build and test the online portfolio system while seeking out excellent University of Maine undergraduate student work from all disciplines for online publication. The staff works under the supervision of New Media faculty member Mike Scott and alongside employees of ASAP Media Services. In the future, the Maine Journal publication and portfolio system will be a self-sufficient system for archiving and publicizing excellent undergraduate work at the University of Maine. Articles for the publication will be created by students in the portfolio system and then pushed to the publication so that a staff will no longer be necessary.
